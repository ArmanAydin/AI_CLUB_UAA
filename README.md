# AI_CLUB_UAA
OpenCV3 &amp; TensorFlow with Applications

This is the official curriculum of the Uskudar American Academy's Artificial Intelligence Club

The repository is dedicated to educational purposes and models/programs that are created by the members of this club.

The tutorials are for OpenCV3.x and Tensorflow with both Python3 and Python2. 

While we suggest you create a virtual environment for your Python Projects, Anaconda initialized with PyCharm is also a good environment to write your code.



The URL's for instillation of:


OpenCV3 ==> https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/install-opencv-3-for-python-on-mac/
            https://robferguson.org/blog/2017/10/06/how-to-install-opencv-and-python-using-homebrew-on-macos-sierra/



TensorFlow ==> https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac



Online Free Trial GPU ==> https://www.paperspace.com/



The tutorials are put up weekly and the directory sequence of these python files are /Module_x/Chapter_x/x.py

The club will be held every Thursday after school and by the end of the academic year you'll be put together into teams and will be expected to come up with a useful application combining Tensorflow API and OpenCV algorithms.

This years our main goal is to make help programmers who already know Python to an extent (or have a programming experience with any other language) familiar with Computer Vision and Neural Networks.
