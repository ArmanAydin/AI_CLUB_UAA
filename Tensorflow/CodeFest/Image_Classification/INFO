In this part of the Neural Network we will be getting the famous Kaggle's Cats vs. Dogs Competition's data.

You can obtain it through their website:
===> https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

1. Just download it ( though it will take some time because you're downloading nearly 3000 images of cats and dogs) and unzip it.


2. Save the directory as 'training'.


3. Place it under your parent directory that you've created.


4. This directory should also have an empty folder named 'summary_log' so that you can both save your model and look how your
model is progressing through TensorBoard.

5. NOTE: A CPU on your computer is not a suitable device to train a model like this even though we only have 2 tags. A GPU of
some kind is necessary. Running this program in your computer will both consume a lot of energy and cause overheating.
